# Project XenXenXenSe
A Modern RESTful API implemenation of XenAPI for Citrix XenServer® and XCP-ng.  
Try not to confuse with [ZenZenZenSe (前前前世)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenzenzense). 

## What is this?
Contrary to XenAPI which requires specific instruction of that calls command, get reference, request. Instead, it uses advantages of Object Oriented Asynchrounous Python and RESTful API to create "translation layer" for XenAPI.
